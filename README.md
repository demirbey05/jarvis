# jarvis.rl


*jarvis.rl* is collection of algorithms and environments for Reinforcement Learning. Recent advancements in AI showed that RL is inevitable part of robust AI. In this repository, I want to implement rl algorithm as many as I can. At the end of this repo, I am planning to reach AlphaZero equivalent agent.
